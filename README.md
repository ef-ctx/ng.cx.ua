> AngularJS service(s) for browser detection. Digest friendly.

Patterns were taken from https://github.com/g13n/ua.js/blob/master/src/ua.js but implementation was optimized for minimal
foot-print and overhead:
- RegExps are created only if invoked
- Results cached, only detects once

Unit tests cover 300+ real world UA strings. This exercise proves the point that UA detection has severe limitations
and you should do feature detection instead.

## Getting Started

Add **ng.cx.ua** to you project.

Via bower:

```
$ bower install --save ng.cx.ua
```

Include the following JS in your build.
- dist/ng.cx.ua.js OR dist/ng.cx.ua.min.js


## Contributing

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make it even better than it is today!

Make sure you read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.


## Developing

Clone this repository, install the dependencies and simply run `grunt develop`.

```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ grunt develop
```

At this point, the source examples included were built into the `build/` directory and a simple webserver is launched so
that you can browse the documentation, the examples and the code coverage.


## Todo

###Â Feature detection (possibly in a different module)

Implement mininmal feature detection in a different service cxUAFeatures)
